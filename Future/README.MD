# What comes next?

Since the messages are stored in a database to query, next would be to look for patterns in the data based on certain parameters

### What will we be looking for
For this example we will be looking for users sentiment about the market - Apple Inc. to start
After cleaning all of the data we need to make a determination about how the client feels given a particular security and make a decision about what to do next based on the sentiment
